# LumiTool

A tool that allows for many different manipulations on Unity Asset Bundles. Made with BDSP mods in mind.

## Features

- Setting a bundle's Platform.
- Adding MonoScripts to a bundle's type tree.
- Converting edited map bundles that were newly built in Unity (ripped using AssetRipper) back into proper bundles for BDSP.
  - Requires reassigning shaders. The tool will automatically ask for those.

## Planned Features

I don't know! At this point we can pretty much just do everything in Unity.
