# LumiTool

A tool that allows for many different manipulations on Unity Asset Bundles. Made with BDSP mods in mind.

## Features

- Setting a bundle's Platform.
- Adding MonoScripts to a bundle's type tree.

## Planned Features

- Merging newly Unity-built bundles with Vanilla BDSP bundles by automatically re-adjusting materials and shaders.
- Adding both a MonoScript and MonoBehaviour at once with specific default values.
